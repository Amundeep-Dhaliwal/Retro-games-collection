# Games_collection
This project is far from complete!
Nearly all the programs use pygame.

Current games include:

-21 blackjack
-Connect 4
-Hangman
-Memory puzzle
-Pong
-Space Invaders
-Simulate
-Slide puzzle
-Tetris
-Tic tac toe
-Wormy

Known bugs/features to implement:

21 blackjack:
  - Needs a pygame implementation

Connect 4:
  - AI required
  - Refactoring- need to retrict the use of 'magic' numbers. 
  - Improved script to be uploaded

Hangman:
  - A hints feature to give an idea of the category of the word

Memory puzzle:
  - A high score system to show prior scores

Pong:
  - Requires a pygame implementation
  - Ball randomly speeds up/slows down
  - Collision detection and movement speed need improving

Space invaders:
  - Script definitely needs refactoring
  - Occasionally player lasers come from beyond the players view
  - Background parallax

Simulate:
  - High score system

Slide puzzle:
  - Stop watch pauses when player presses solve
  - A menu screen sould be shown prior to the puzzle where the player can choose the dimensions of the board

Tetris:
  - A timer could be implemented
  - Additional keyboard mappings
 
Tic tac toe:
  -pygame implementation not complete

Wormy:
  - A rainbow effect for the game over screen
  

Any additional feedback on the python files would be very much appreciated.

This project would not be where is today without the help of the following amazing programmers:

-Al Sweigart (I recommend his book on inventing games with pygame)
-Tim Ruscica 
-Countless members of the Stack Overflow community
